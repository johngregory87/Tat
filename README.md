# Features

Tauticord uses the Tautulli API to pull information from Tautulli and display them in a Discord channel, including:

### Overview:

* Number of current streams
* Number of transcoding streams
* Total bandwidth
* Total LAN bandwidth
* Total remote bandwidth
* Library item counts

### For each stream:

* Stream state (playing, paused, stopped, loading)
* Media type (tv show/movie/song/photo)
* User
* Media title
* Product and player
* Quality profile
* Stream bandwidth
* If stream is transcoding
* Progress of stream
* ETA of stream completion

Administrator (the bot owner) can react to Tauticord's messages to terminate a specific stream (if they have Plex Pass).

Users can also indicate what libraries they would like monitored. Tauticord will create/update a voice channel for each
library name with item counts every hour.

You can also set these variables via a configuration file:

1. Map the `/config` directory (see volumes above)
2. Enter the mapped directory on your host machine
3. Rename the ``config.yaml.example`` file in the path to ``config.yaml``
4. Complete the variables in ``config.yaml``

Please note, if the `config.yaml` file is present, the application will ONLY use this file for
configuration. If you are going to use it, you need to fill it out in its entirety.

## Run without Docker

You can run Tauticord outside of Docker by cloning this repository and either:

- renaming `config.yaml.example` to `config.yaml`, filling out the settings inside `config.yaml` and running the bot
  with `python3 run.py --config config.yaml`
- adding the above environmental variables to your system and running the bot with `python3 run.py`

Please note, this is NOT ADVISED. Running this application as a Docker container is the only officially-supported method
of running Tauticord.

# Common Issues

- On startup, Tauticord attempts to upload a set of custom emojis that it will use when displaying stream information (
  if they do not already exist). Your bot will need to have the `Manage Emojis` permission in order to do this.
    - Discord has a limit of 50 custom emojis per server. If you have reached this limit, you will need to remove some
      of your existing emojis before Tauticord can upload its own.
    - If you do not want to remove any of your existing emojis, Tauticord will simply skip uploading its own emojis and
      use the default emojis that Discord provides instead.

# Analytics

Tauticord uses Google Analytics to collect statistics such as common errors that will help with future development.
**This data is limited, anonymous, and never sold or redistributed.**

**When and what data is collected?**

- Whenever the bot comes online
    - What operating system the bot is running on (Windows, Linux, MacOS, etc.)
- Whenever an error is logged
    - What function the error occurred in.

**What data is NOT collected:**

- Any identifying information about the user
- Any identifying information about the computer/machine (a random ID is generated on each analytics call, IP addresses
  are anonymized)
- Settings for Discord or Tautulli, including passwords, API tokens, URLs, etc.
- Any data from Tautulli
- Anything typed in Discord.

# Performance Monitoring

Tauticord will attempt to query the system it is running on for CPU and RAM usage every 5 minutes.

Tautulli does not currently offer a way to query performance statistics from its API. As a result, this data is **not
Tautulli-specific performance data**, but rather **the performance of the system that Tauticord is running on**.

If Tauticord is running on the same system as Tautulli, then this data may reflect the performance of Tautulli (+
Tauticord and all other processes running on the system).

If Tauticord is running on a different system than Tautulli, or is running isolated in a Docker container, then this
data will not reflect the performance of Tautulli.

# Development

This bot is still a work in progress. If you have any ideas for improving or adding to Tauticord, please open an issue
or a pull
request.
